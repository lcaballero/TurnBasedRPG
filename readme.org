* Introduction to TurnBasedRPG
  The code here is based on the HaxeFlixel [[https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/tutorial/][tutorial]] called
  TurnBasedRPG.  It has some custom changes.

  Instead of using 'a', 'w', 's', 'd' it uses the right-hand side of
  the key-board.  So instead it uses 'j', 'i', 'k', 'l' keys.
